# Day 1: Python Fundamentals & Data Handling Basics

**📅 Date:** 2025-07-19

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- ✅ Install Python and Set Up the Environment
- ✅ Understand Basic Python Syntax
- ✅ Work with Variables and Data Types (int, float, str, bool)
- ✅ Use Arithmetic, Comparison & Logical Operators
- ✅ Perform Basic Input and Output (`print()`, `input()`)

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- **Python Installation:** Installed Python 3.x and pip, configured PATH variables.
- **First Script:** Created and ran a "Hello, Data World!" script.
- **Variables & Data Types:** Declared variables, used `type()` to inspect them.
- **Operators Practice:** Practiced arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`), comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.), and logical (`and`, `or`, `not`) operations.
- **Input/Output:** Used `input()` and `print()` to interact with the user and display formatted results.

## ✍️ Reflections

Day 1 was a crucial first step. I learned how to set up the environment, run Python scripts, and understand basic data handling concepts.  
Excited to continue building on this strong foundation in the coming days!
